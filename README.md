# DeveloperStore - A CRUD API with DDD and C#

## Overview
This project is a CRUD API built using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and C# with .NET 8. It represents my journey learning DDD architecture and Entity Framework Core in a short timeframe.

## Project Structure
The solution follows DDD layers:

- **Domain Layer**: Core business rules and entities
- **Application Layer**: Application services and DTOs
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Data persistence and cross-cutting concerns
- **API Layer**: REST endpoints and controllers

## Current Features
- Complete CRUD operations for:
  - Customers
  - Sales
  - Sale Items (Products)
- Domain-driven architecture
- Entity Framework Core with SQLite
- Dependency Injection with Autofac
- DTOs and Mapping patterns

## Learning Journey
This project represents an intensive learning experience with:
- DDD principles and implementation
- Entity Framework Core setup and configuration
- Dependency Injection
- Microservices
- API
- Clean Architecture practices
- SOLID principles application

## Technical Challenges Overcome
- Implementing repository patterns
- Configuring dependency injection
- Managing entity relationships

## Work in Progress
Currently working on:
- Bug fixes on runtime
- Setting up proper DDD layer separation
- Better error handling
- API documentation with Swagger
- Database creation (SQLite)
- Code improvements

## Future Improvements
Planning to add:
- More functionalities
- Performance optimizations
- Clear and cleaner project organization

## Running the Project
(Instructions coming soon)

## Technologies Used
- .NET 8
- Entity Framework Core
- Autofac
- SQLite

## Final Thoughts
While building this project in a short timeframe was challenging, it provided valuable insights into DDD architecture and modern .NET development practices. The learning curve was steep but rewarding, especially in understanding how different layers interact in a domain-driven application.
Unfortunately it still have some flaws and bugs, but i only had 4 days and a couple of nights creating this due to my on site daily job. And considering i'm still learning DDD and Entity Framework Core, it was really challenging but also learned a lot in the process.

Above all i'll keep fixing and improving this project because i think is such a great way of learning new concepts and achitecture to improve myself
as a software developer.

Errors that i'm facing now: 

Circular dependencies, now i learning how to solve this, i understood what it means and also how this impact in my project and also on architecture choices
to make the project more understandable, semantic and way better correct following DDD best practices.
